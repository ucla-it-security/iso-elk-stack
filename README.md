# ELK Stack 5.2.x
** This project will soon be transitioning to a new UCLA repo, under which a new security-focused ELK stack v5.0 will be launched. See https://github.com/UCLA-LBBP-Neuromodulation/UC-elk-stack-security.**

# iso-elk-stack

The UCLA Information Security Office customized an integration of Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (the "ELK stack") to extract security-specific information, richly visualize that data, and create notifications based on specific concerns. 

For installation instructions for both the central ELK server and client servers (that use log-courier to ship events to the central ELK server), please visit the following link and select the "Install" tab: https://www.itsecurity.ucla.edu/elk

**Major Changes**:

As of November 25th, 2015, this project has been updated to reflect the major changes reflected in Elasticsearch 2.1, Logstash 2.1, and Kibana 4.3. In addition, support for Filebeat, Packetbeat, and Topbeat was added and documentation is available at the link on the UCLA Information Security website listed above.

As of January 14th, 2016, (and after a long period of stability testing), shipping logs from Windows Servers via nxlog was included, as was the ability to ship OSSEC (http://ossec.github.io/) security log data to the UCLA-ISO-ELK configuration. We're major fans of OSSEC and nxlog.
